Analysis of Factors Influencing Movie Revenue (Gross) in IMDb Dataset

Description:
This project focuses on the analysis of movie data from IMDb with the goal of understanding the factors that influence a movie's revenue (Gross). The dataset includes 6820 movies from 1986 to 2016, averaging 220 movies per year. Each movie in this dataset has several attributes, including:

Budget: The movie's production budget. Some movies may not have this data, appearing as 0.
Company: The movie production company.
Country: The country of origin for the movie.
Director: The movie director.
Genre: The main genre of the movie.
Gross: The revenue generated by the movie.
Name: The movie title.
Rating: The movie rating (R, PG, etc.).
Released: The release date of the movie (YYYY-MM-DD).
Runtime: The duration of the movie.
Score: The IMDb user rating.
Votes: The number of user votes on IMDb.
Star: The main actor or actress in the movie.
Writer: The writer of the movie.
Year: The release year of the movie.
Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of these factors to understand the correlations among them, with a specific focus on the high correlation between the number of votes (votes) and production budget (budget) with movie revenue (Gross). Utilizing data analysis techniques and visualizations, this project aims to provide profound insights into how these variables are interrelated, particularly focusing on how the correlation between votes, budget, and gross can offer a better understanding of a movie's financial success.

Analysis Methodology:

Data Cleaning: Ensuring the data is free from missing values (NaN) and outliers.
Correlation Analysis: Employing statistical techniques to measure and comprehend the relationships between the involved variables.
Data Visualization: Creating visualizations such as heatmaps to clarify patterns and correlations among variables.
Conclusion: Summarizing findings from the analysis, especially regarding the relationship between votes, budget, and gross in the context of movie success.
Key Findings:
In this analysis, it has been identified that the number of votes (votes) and production budget (budget) are the primary factors with the highest correlation with movie revenue (Gross). These findings provide valuable insights for the film industry and decision-makers in planning movie productions and marketing strategies.

Note: This project is an exploration of data and statistical analysis. While the results provide valuable insights, they are not conclusive business decision recommendations.
